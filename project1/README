Lab1a limitations:
1. Cannot parse subshell with multiple commands.
2. Cannot parse subshell with one command followed by or following more than 2 '\n's.

Design problem lab1c:
We implement the second design problem of lab1c which requires to limit the amount of parallelism to at most N subprocesses, where N is a parameter that you can set by an argument to the shell. 

We implement this function by using shared memory and semaphore. To use the limitation option, you need type -n option with argument. E.g.

./timetrash -t -n 5 test.sh

This command will limit the amount to 5. 

To illustrate the effect, we design a -v option which will force each process sleep 3 seconds before they exit. It will be very easy to see the parallelism.
